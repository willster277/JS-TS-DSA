# JS-TS-DSA: JavaScript/TypeScript Data Structures and Algorithms

## Development approach

1. Determine the DSA to be implemented.
2. Write a public interface for the baseline features class instance or function.
3. Write a public interface for the additional features class instance or function.
4. Write test cases based on the public interface.
  i. Test the base functionality of the DSA
  ii. Test the additional functionality of the DSA
  iii. Test the DSA in a real use case
  iv. Test the DSA in edge cases
5. Implement the class or function.
